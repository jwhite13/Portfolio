# Portfolio
This is an ongoing project in which I am trying to learn to create a website using Django. 
In order to do this, I have built a personal portfolio showing some of the work I have done in the past years.
This is very much an ongoing project, and as such is incomplete and quite rough around the edges.
The deployed prototype can be found at:
